## Opening A New Restaurant in Canberra Using Machine Learning

## Data
Solving this problem through machine learning is going to take a lot of data related to the people of Canberra and their 
food choices. To accumulate this data I'll aim to use one or more of these sources -

### Foursquare API

The Foursquare API will help me get the data on which suburbs have what type of buildings/dwellings. I will query the API to get the number of each type of buildings in an area and map that out on the map of Canberra. This makes a difference in the overall decision to open the restaurant, as opening a restaurant near office spaces, residential area can be pretty 
advantageous for business.

### SafeGraph GPS 

I can also utilise SafeGraph's GPS data to determine the footfall in a particular area/suburb in Canberra. SafeGraph provides the anonymous GPS movement data of its users, which is very useful to determine the footfall in an area of the city. An area with higher footfall but comparitively lesser number of restaurants can be a good place to open a restaurant.

### Yelp / Foursquare

I also want to utilise Yelp or Foursquare API to get people's reviews on resturants of an area. If a particular cuisine's 
reviews are not very good in a suburb, then maybe it would be a good idea to open a new restaurant featuring that particular 
cuisine in that area. 

So, in this way, I can make an educated guess as to where to open a restaurant in Canberra.
