## Opening A New Restaurant in Canberra Using Machine Learning

This project will aim to make an educated prediction of what might be the best place to open a new restaurant using the 
Foursquare API and machine learning learning approach. There are over 200 restaurants in the city of Canberra. So, when 
opening a new restaurant, one of the most important decision an owner can make is to choose the location wisely. 

Canberra is the capital city of Australia and has an estimated population of about 447,692 in the year 2018. According to the 
2016 ABS Census data, the median age of residents is about 37 years, and about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub><sup>rd</sup> of the 
population is under the age of 25 years. So, naturally, a lot of them like to go out during the weekends. Also, Canberra is 
home to one of the largest universities in Australia (The Australian National University) and other established 
universities like University of Canberra and Canberra Institute of Technology. These universities attract a lot of international 
students and academics every year. 

So, it's safe to say that Canberra is also culturally rich and ethnically diverse. It's also a crucial decision to decide what 
cuisine to serve at the restaurant. To help the owner make these decision, I want to use Machine Learning and Foursquare API 
to come up with a solution that can predict which area/suburb would be the perfect spot to open a new restaurant to maximise 
footfall. Also, Foursquare API and the Yelp API can be utilised to determine what kind of cuisine is preferred by the people of
a suburb/area.

In this way, I think I can make fairly good prediciton for the choice of a restaurant in the city, and this would help maximise 
the profit of the owner.
